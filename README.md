# What are we doing?
We are going to build an API endpoint that allows us to fetch data from a public, third-party API.  Essentially, we are going to create a "wrapper" that integrates to an external API so that we can easily query data from the external API.

# What will we be using?
We will use Python, the FastAPI python framework, Uvicorn for the server, an HTTP client, and python-dotenv for managing our environment variables (if we even have any).

# Why are we using these?
Python is super easy to use.  FastAPI is very beginner-friendly and has some nice features like built in Swagger doc generation and input validation.
